Uses one of our local SPARQL endpoints (http://lgd.aksw.org:8900/sparql), which is not guaranteed to run/keep this data in the future so
you may have to use another SPARQL endpoint.

The matching is a bit complicated because it is "LinkedCT facility is located in GHO country" and we use the path "linkedct:location_facility/linkedct:facility_address/linkedct:address_country/rdfs:label" for matching.
