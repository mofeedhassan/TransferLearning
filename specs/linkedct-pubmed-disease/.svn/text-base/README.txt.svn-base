Evaluation of samples of the intervals 0.7-0.75,...,0.95-1 (excluding 1) with 50 random instances each are included in the "intervals" folder.
Because even the precision of the interval [0.95,1) is very low (33/50 ~ 0.66), only the ones with a score of 1 are included in the links.nt file.

3602 links are contained in links.nt.

The matching is done with a selfmodified version of silk that includes a "synonym"-metric which uses a list of synonmyms for the matching. So this does *not* match with standard Silk.
